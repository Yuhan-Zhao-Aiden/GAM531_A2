# Assignment 2: Vector & Matrix Operations in C#

**Due Date:** September 16  
**Points:** 5 pts  

---

## üéØ Objective
Learn how to implement basic **vector** and **matrix** operations in C#.  
These operations form the foundation of transformations in graphics programming (rotations, scaling, etc.).

---

## üìå Requirements

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a new C# project using **SharpDX** or **OpenTK**.  
   - You may continue from your Assignment 1 project.

2. **Vector Operations**
   - Addition  
   - Subtraction  
   - Dot product  
   - Cross product  

3. **Matrix Operations**
   - Identity matrix  
   - Scaling  
   - Rotation (at least around one axis)  
   - Multiplication  

4. **Test Program (Main Method)**
   - Demonstrate vector operations (print results to console).  
   - Apply a scaling and rotation matrix to a vector and print the result.  
   - Ensure the program **compiles and runs without errors**.

5. **GitHub Repository**
   - Push your project to a **public GitHub repo**.  
   - Include:
     - All `.cs` source files  
     - A `README.md` with:
       - Which library you used  
       - Which operations you implemented  
       - Example output from your test program
